# coursera_applied_datascience

This repository includes all the tasks I worked on during the course Applied Data Science Capstone, which is part of the microdegree of Applied Data Science Specialization by Coursera & IBM. This repository mainly serves the purpose of backup and presentation to fulfill the course requirements.

Most of the Jupyter notebooks were done using the cloud-based Skills Network Labs provided by Coursera. Some I worked on locally with Visual Studio Code and the Jupyter Plugin.
